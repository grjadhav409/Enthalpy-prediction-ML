# Enthalpy-prediction-ML

# discription

Physical properties of molecules play's very important role in designing chemical processes. In this project I have collected experimental data of standard enthalpy of formation of diverse compunds. This dataset collection is of common names and their experimental enthalpy values. To represent this molecules I have converted common names to SMILES and then calculated various kind of fingerprints and physicochemical disictriptors. I've used sklearn library to train various ML models.
